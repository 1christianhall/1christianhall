Hello, world. 

I've been creating software as an engineer/architect or product manager for a very long time so have touched many (thousands, probably) 
technologies...and it's still a joy to dig into new things when I have the opportunity.

Lately I have been revisiting data/analytics engineering using dbt along with BigQuery, some Python here and there, Powerapps and Power BI 
even though I've only occasionally bumped into Microsoft tools through the years (many, many years in Java, Spring, etc. on unix systems).  

I've always had an interest in music production, MIDI, synthesis, etc. Someday, it would be fun to learn audio signal processing in code. 

Also, I am an avid boardgamer and would enjoy producing a game online such as for boardgamearena. 

If only there were more time.

Hello, world. 

Lately I have been revisiting data/analytics engineering using dbt along with BigQuery, some Python here and there, Powerapps and Power BI and some front-end design.  

I've always had an interest in music production, MIDI, synthesis, etc. Someday, it would be fun to learn audio signal processing in code. 

Also, I am an avid boardgamer and would enjoy producing a game online such as for boardgamearena. 

If only there were more time.
